### About

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the abput section</b></p></summary>

This is the first release for my `GitHub_Stats_A` repository, a repository for generating GitHub statistics through a workflow. The process is powered by an access token, which expires after a month. This project was divided into 1 month seasons, and today is the last day of season 1, and also the first day of season 2. So I am publishing the first release for this project.

This release includes:

- [x] Data from 2022 June 12th to 2022 July 11th
- [x] A compilation folder of all SVG files used
- [x] A season 1 folder that overviews the run across the first 30 days
- [x] An error log
- [x] The original files from the original repository, along with a modified `README.md` file, and several license fles
