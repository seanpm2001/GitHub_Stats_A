# Log data incomplete (2022, June)

In the end of 2022 November (specifically on 2022 November 28th) I was planning to go back and archive all older logs. Unfortunately, I waited too long. Logs appear to automatically expire within 6 months. Consistent log data will stay for 2022 September 18th onward, but data before this is unfortunately gone forever.

## Expiration message
