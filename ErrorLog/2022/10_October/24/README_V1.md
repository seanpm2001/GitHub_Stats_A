# No unique errors

## 2022 October 24th

The workflow ran (somewhat) successfully today. There are no unique errors to display here, but logs are still available.

**Side note:** GitHub completely refused to let me download the logs on 2022, October 24th. I tried my main account, my alt account, and no account, but it just timing out (infinitely trying to download the file, but never doing anything) I couldn't download other logs either, so I assumed there was a problem with GitHub actions. As usual, the GitHub status website did not give any information or acknowledgement of the problem, I wonder why they even bother having the site up. I was prepared to extract the logs manually, but I decided to wait until 2022, October 25th, when it was working fine again.
