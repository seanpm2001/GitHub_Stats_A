# Successful day

## 2023, Thursday, March 2nd

**Workflow run #237/#238** `&` **#238/#239** (last checked: 2023, Friday, March 3rd)

_The workflow number reports as 1 higher (when downloading logs) than the workload count in the actions menu. A set of images will better explain this._

The workflow ran successfully today. I had to manually run the workflow, as by 6:20 pm PST, it had not yet started. It started running on its own by 7:30 pm PST, by which time, I had to cancel the scheduled run, and keep the manual run going. There may be some unique errors to display here. Workflow run Logs are available, as usual.
