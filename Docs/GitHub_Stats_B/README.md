# `GitHub_Stats_B`

As of 2023, Tuesday, April 25th at 2:34 pm PST, `GitHub_Stats_B` does not exist yet. It is reserved for:

- The possibility that I find a better tool to get GitHub statistics
- The possibility that `GitHub_Stats_`A` stops functioning entirely.
- The upcoming need to experiment with a new GitHub statistics method.

**üå±Ô∏è This [`README.md`](/Docs/GitHub_Stats_B/README.md) file is a _major_ stub, and needs _significant_ expansion.**
