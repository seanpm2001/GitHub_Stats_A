<!-- Notes 2023.03.01
GHSA
Fear of workflow taking too long (6+ hours) to process all repositories as quantity rises
SEASON10
!-->

The process ran successfully today, succeeding within 2 hours, 2 minutes and 34 seconds.

The month started out with a success, I am hoping it remains successful for at least 60% of the month, and that it doesn't start acting up again. Lately, I have been fearing that my set of repositories might become so complex that the workflow can't process all repositories within 6 hours (GitHubs workflow time limit)

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.
 
For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate has stayed at 100% for over a month.

I put the workflow runs into 33 categories:

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the category listing]</b><p></summary>

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run successfully_

**2023, Thursday, March 2nd**

The process ran successfully today, succeeding within 1 hour, 36 minutes and 8 seconds. I had to manually run the workflow today, as it hadn't stared by 6:30 pm PST. Later on before 7:30 pm PST, the workflow began its scheduled run, which I had to cancel, as there was already an instance running.

Today was another consecutive successful workflow run day. I am hoping it remains successful for at least 60% of the month, and that it doesn't start acting up again. Lately, I have been fearing that my set of repositories might become so complex that the workflow can't process all repositories within 6 hours (GitHubs workflow time limit)

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**
