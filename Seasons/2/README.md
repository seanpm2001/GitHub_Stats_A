# Season 2

| :octocat: | Previous season [`1`](/Seasons/1/) | **Current season:** [`2`](/Seasons/2/) | Next season [`3`](/Seasons/3/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the second season (30 days, day 31-59) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires) If results are sufficient, I may renew it for a third season. I could have extended it to 60 or 90 days, but I think 30 day intervals is the preferred way of doing this.

A large segment (almost half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 12 days and counting.

### 2022 July 12th

</details>

**2022 July 12th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave poor results. At least it ran on its last day with the first access token. This was its fifth consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 2 day.

Today, Java fell off the top 15, with SVG replacing it.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

### 2022 July 13th

</details>

**2022 July 13th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave accurate results, which it hasn't done in over 2 weeks. This was its sixth consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 4 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

The line of code count is now over 109 million. The 8 million line jump was due to importing 3 versions of Swift, 1 version of Pascal, and 1 version of Python into the WacOS project source repository.

The process took an additional 5 minutes after the images were generated and pushed to main, despite everything being done.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

### 2022 July 14th

**2022 July 14th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave inaccurate results. This was its seventh consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 3 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

The process didn't start until its latest instance tonight, not starting until 7:44 pm PST.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly.

### 2022 July 15th

</details>

**2022 July 15th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave inaccurate results. This was its eighth consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 3 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

The process started early today, and I have learned to like having both inaccurate and accurate results, because they both give off different variations of stats.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

### 2022 July 17th

</details>

**2022 July 17th**

The process ran successfully today and gave full results. Today was its first consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P.

For this repository, I am now including error dumps in Python traceback format (`*.pytb`) which will still be viewable as plain text through `README.pytb` files.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P.
