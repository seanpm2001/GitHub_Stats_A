# Season 2

|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the second season (30 days, day 31-59) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires) If results are sufficient, I may renew it for a third season. I could have extended it to 60 or 90 days, but I think 30 day intervals is the preferred way of doing this.

A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting.

**2022 July 12th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave poor results. At least it ran on its last day with the first access token. This was its fifth consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 2 day.

Today, Java fell off the top 15, with SVG replacing it.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

**2022 July 13th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave accurate results, which it hasn't done in over 2 weeks. This was its sixth consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 4 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

The line of code count is now over 109 million. The 8 million line jump was due to importing 3 versions of Swift, 1 version of Pascal, and 1 version of Python into the WacOS project source repository.

The process took an additional 5 minutes after the images were generated and pushed to main, despite everything being done.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

The process ran successfully today, but gave inaccurate results. This was its seventh consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_

Today was a category 3 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

The process didn't start until its latest instance tonight, not starting until 7:44 pm PST.

The process ran successfully today, but gave inaccurate results. This was its eighth consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_

- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 3 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

The process started early today, and I have learned to like having both inaccurate and accurate results, because they both give off different variations of stats.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly.

For this repository, I am now including error dumps in Python traceback format (`*.pytb`) which will still be viewable as plain text through `README.pytb` files.

Yesterday, I deleted 140 organizations (14%) on 2022, August 5th, I deleted another 80 (totaling 22% deleted) on 2022 August 6th, and another 60 (totaling 28% deleted) on 2022 August 7th. it is going to take me at least a week to delete all of them. I expect to be done by 2022, Tuesday, August 16th, but I likely won't have my account back on the same day.

I am starting to fear that I won't have my account back by 2022, August 10th, and that the access token will expire before I can renew it. On 2022, August 2nd, it reached the point where an entire half of the season does not have data, as my account was flagged.

**2022 August 9th**

My GitHub account was still suspended today (day 22, or 3 weeks, 1 day) so the process couldn't run. That is the least of my problems, this has caused me an unimaginable amount of stress and fear for several days now, but has been calm since. I am still extremely disappointed and a bit frustrated each day I log on to find that I am still flagged. I recently got a response, but now I had to do the hard thing and delete all my organizations, a huge disappointment to me, and the most painful thing this year. Once this is done, the next appeal will likely go through.

Unfortunately, another fork got thrown in the road, GitHub is refusing to delete my organizations, and also is refusing to let me delete my organizations. There is probably some sneaky workaround, but I am completely stumped now. Update: they unlocked the fork option after my request was rejected. Yesterday, I deleted 140 organizations (14%) on 2022, August 5th, I deleted another 80 (totaling 22% deleted) on 2022 August 6th, and another 60 (totaling 28% deleted) on 2022 August 7th. it is going to take me at least a week to delete all of them.

Today, the fear came true. Season 2 has ended, with no data for 23 days out of 30 (76.66% of the time) I am unsure how renewal will work.
