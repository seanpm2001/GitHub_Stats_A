This is an oveview of the second season (30 days, day 31-59) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires) If results are sufficient, I may renew it for a third season. I could have extended it to 60 or 90 days, but I think 30 day intervals is the preferred way of doing this.

### 2022 July 12th

</details>

**2022 July 12th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave poor results. At least it ran on its last day with the first access token. This was its fifth consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 2 day.

Today, Java fell off the top 15, with SVG replacing it.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.
