<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

**2022 September ?th**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, failing within 3 minutes, and breaking its 1 day consecutive streak.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 0 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

For this repository, I am now including error dumps in Python traceback format (`*.pytb`) which will still be viewable as plain text through `README.pytb` files.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

**2022 September 25th**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, although it gave incomplete results. The process finished in 21 seconds, and gave empty data. The access token expired a day earlier than expected, and I had to renew it today. This will be the data for today.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R1200` - _Partial success, with 1200-1299 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1300` - _Partial success, with 1300-1399 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `R1400` - _Partial success, with 1400-1499 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 5:** `R1500` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 6:** `R1600` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 7:** `R1700` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 8:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 0 day.

**2022 September 26th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave complete results. The process finished in 2 hours, 46 minutes, and 9 seconds. There were no errors in the logs for today, except for retrying paths. None of them resulted in an actual error, which I think is why the workflow executed perfectly today.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
