**2022 September ?th**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, failing within 3 minutes, and breaking its 1 day consecutive streak.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 0 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

For this repository, I am now including error dumps in Python traceback format (`*.pytb`) which will still be viewable as plain text through `README.pytb` files.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

The process ran unsuccessfully today, although it gave incomplete results. The process finished in 21 seconds, and gave empty data. The access token expired a day earlier than expected, and I had to renew it today. This will be the data for today.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_

- **Category 6:** `R1600` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_

The process ran successfully today, and gave complete results. The process finished in 2 hours, 46 minutes, and 9 seconds. There were no errors in the logs for today, except for retrying paths. None of them resulted in an actual error, which I think is why the workflow executed perfectly today.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

The process ran somewhat successfully today, and gave incomplete results. The process finished in 1 hours, 33 minutes, and 1 second, over an hour and 5 minutes less than yesterday, yet giving similar results.

The process ran unsuccessfully today, failing within 55 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today, there was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully.

**2022 September 30th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave extremely poor results. It retrived my username, but didn't give full results, a first. Forth and Tcl also ranked in the top 14, despite little usage. Less than 600 repositories were scanned. There were no `aiohttp` errors today.

The process ran successfully today, but gave extremely poor results again. It retrived my username, but didn't give full results, the same as yesterday. Forth and Tcl also again ranked in the top 14, despite little usage. Less than 600 repositories were scanned. I feel like something changed in the GitHub API recently, as I noticed a similar problem with another statistic. It seems to only be able to retrive data from the current year, and not on or before 2021 December 31st. There were no `aiohttp` errors today.

**2022 October 2nd**

The process ran successfully today, but gave extremely poor results yet again today. It retrived my username, but didn't give full results, the same as yesterday and the day before. I am getting sick of this. Less than 600 repositories were scanned. I feel like something changed in the GitHub API recently, as I noticed a similar problem with another statistic. It seems to only be able to retrive data from the current year, and not on or before 2021 December 31st. That issue resolved itself within 2 hours of me mentioning it yesterday, but the issue here is still unresolved. There were no `aiohttp` errors today.

It retrieved my username, but didn't give full results, the same as yesterday and the day before and the day before that. I have been forgetting to mention that it also finishes within an hour. Today, it took an extra 20 minutes, but gave poor results. I am still waiting to contact the developer. It seems to be getting better on its own. Less than 700 repositories were scanned.

For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

**2022 October 5th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave extremely poor results yet again today. It retrieved my username, but didn't give full results, the same as recently. It also skipped my contribution count. Today, it took a little over 1 hour, but gave poor results. I am still waiting to contact the developer. It seems to be getting better on its own. Less than 700 repositories were scanned. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. Normal errors weren't present today (normal errors being "There were too many errors, Data for this repository may be incomplete")

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R1200` - _Partial success, with 1200-1299 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1300` - _Partial success, with 1300-1399 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `R1400` - _Partial success, with 1400-1499 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 5:** `R1500` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 6:** `R1600` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 7:** `R1700` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 8:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 1 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, failing within 1 minute and 2 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today, there was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. I now know the meaning of runtime errors. Additionally, I received this error today:

**Build**

Node.js 12 actions are deprecated. For more information see: [https://github.blog/changelog/2022-09-22-github-actions-all-actions-will-begin-running-on-node16-instead-of-node12/](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-09-22-github-actions-all-actions-will-begin-running-on-node16-instead-of-node12/). Please update the following actions to use Node.js 16: actions/checkout, actions/setup-python, actions/cache, actions/checkout

I don't know why JavaScript is in use, this extension is written entirely in Python. I don't know how to fix this error, but it may have not been the cause of the workflow failing today.
