**2023 Saturday, July 1st**

The workflow did not run today. I worked on the project a bit late, and reactivated the workflow near 6:00 pm PST. It did not start on its own because of this, not running until the next day. I didn't manually start it, as I didn't want another workflow to start while I was away and cause a conflict. No logs are available for today.

I decided not to update the repository today due to this, holding off the next update until the day after the next workflow run, which ran on 2023, Sunday, July 2nd.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 40 minutes and 59 seconds. It only scanned 900 repositories. Even with the limited amount of repositories scanned, I noticed a massive uptick in profile track.

**2023, Monday, July 3rd**

The workflow had an unsuccessful day today, failing within 6 hours, 00 minutes and 00 seconds, although it additionally took 57 minutes and 16 seconds to find a runner and start. It appears to have gotten stuck in an infinite loop today, which caused it to hit the 6 hour workflow time limit and fail. I don't feel it has gotten to the point where a full success would take over 6 hours. It was a bit disappointing to see this the next day.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023, Wednesday, July 5th**

The workflow had an unsuccessful day today, failing within 0 hours, 01 minute and 14 seconds. It is shaping up to be a significantly worse month than last month, right now it is failing every other day, with no full success runs yet.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

***

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, May 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

***

### Accuracy issues

Something that recently roused[sic] my suspicion/caught my eye is that the workflow is not accurately reporting the total number of source repositories. On 2023, May 20th, it reported that I had `3,427` repositories with contributions, while at the time of the workflow run, I only had `3,391` source repositories, meaning it was off by `36`. That is a pretty notable margin of error. - Logged on 2023, Tuesday, May 23rd

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.
