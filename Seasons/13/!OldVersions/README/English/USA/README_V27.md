**2023 Saturday, July 1st**

The workflow did not run today. I worked on the project a bit late, and reactivated the workflow near 6:00 pm PST. It did not start on its own because of this, not running until the next day. I didn't manually start it, as I didn't want another workflow to start while I was away and cause a conflict. No logs are available for today.

I decided not to update the repository today due to this, holding off the next update until the day after the next workflow run, which ran on 2023, Sunday, July 2nd.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 40 minutes and 59 seconds. It only scanned 900 repositories. Even with the limited amount of repositories scanned, I noticed a massive uptick in profile track.

**2023, Monday, July 3rd**

The workflow had an unsuccessful day today, failing within 6 hours, 00 minutes and 00 seconds, although it additionally took 57 minutes and 16 seconds to find a runner and start. It appears to have gotten stuck in an infinite loop today, which caused it to hit the 6 hour workflow time limit and fail. I don't feel it has gotten to the point where a full success would take over 6 hours. It was a bit disappointing to see this the next day.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023, Wednesday, July 5th**

The workflow had an unsuccessful day today, failing within 0 hours, 01 minute and 14 seconds. It is shaping up to be a significantly worse month than last month, right now it is failing every other day, with no full success runs yet.

**2023, Thursday, July 6th**

The workflow had an unsuccessful day again today, failing within 0 hours, 01 minute and 14 seconds, the exact same time as yesterday. Failure is now in the strong majority, and the failure every other day pattern streak has been broken. I am hoping for it to turn around at least a little. This month still isn't going to be as good as last month.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023, Friday, July 7th**

The workflow had a partially successful day today, finishing within 1 hour, 24 minutes and 07 seconds. Despite breaking the failure streak, it still did extremely poorly, only scanning 800 repositories. I knew it did worse before I even went to look at the overview image, as the overall Python usage count was WAY too low (less than 3%) this month is still going terribly.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023, Sunday, July 9th**

The workflow had a partially successful day today, finishing within 1 hour, 21 minutes and 33 seconds. Despite only being a partial success, it was still the best it has done so far this month, as it scanned 1200 repositories, instead of 800 or 900. It is still 9 days into the month without a full success, and the failure rate is still higher than the success rate, so this month is already guaranteed to be significantly worse than the last.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023, Monday, July 10th**

The workflow had an unsuccessful day today, failing within 1 minute and 4 seconds. This month is going horribly, now about 1/3 in, with a majority failure rate, and no fully successful runs. I am hoping for just 1 fully successful run within the next 21 days.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023 Tuesday, July 11th**

The workflow did not run at all today. I worked on the project a bit late, and reactivated the workflow near 5:00 pm PST. It did not start on its own because of this, not running until the next day. I didn't manually start it, as I didn't want another workflow to start while I was away and cause a conflict. No logs are available for today. I didn't think the shutoff time was 5:00 pm. I don't think I have ever had the workflow refuse to run for 2 days in one month before.

I decided not to update the repository today due to this, holding off the next update until the day after the next workflow run, which ran on 2023, Sunday, July 13th.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023, Saturday, July 15th**

The workflow had a partially successful day today, finishing within 3 hours, 36 minutes and 15 seconds. Even though it took nearly 2 extra hours, it did extremely poorly, only scanning 900 repositories. I have been beginning to suspect that a recent bug with the GitHub linguist in my Git-Templates repository is causing the workflow to perform badly this month, as I feel it may be scanning up to this repository, then getting stuck (this particular repository is reporting negative language usage, but the internals of the Linguist indicate that data is still being scanned correctly, the logic just isn't being processed correctly) I am wondering if this workflow reads the logic, and not the data. It has been nearly half a month, and the repository has still not had a fully successful run.

**2023, Monday, July 17th**

The workflow had a partially successful day today, finishing within 1 hour, 31 minutes and 03 seconds. Only 900 repositories were scanned today. I have been beginning to suspect that a recent bug with the GitHub linguist in my Git-Templates repository is causing the workflow to perform badly this month, as I feel it may be scanning up to this repository, then getting stuck (this particular repository is reporting negative language usage, but the internals of the Linguist indicate that data is still being scanned correctly, the logic just isn't being processed correctly) I am wondering if this workflow reads the logic, and not the data. It has been over half a month, and the repository has still not had a fully successful run, with a majority failure rate still remaining consistent.

**2023, Tuesday, July 18th**

The workflow had a partially successful again day today, finishing within 1 hour, 37 minutes and 53 seconds. Only 900 repositories were scanned today. I have been beginning to suspect that a recent bug with the GitHub linguist in my Git-Templates repository is causing the workflow to perform badly this month, as I feel it may be scanning up to this repository, then getting stuck (this particular repository is reporting negative language usage, but the internals of the Linguist indicate that data is still being scanned correctly, the logic just isn't being processed correctly) I am wondering if this workflow reads the logic, and not the data. It has been over half a month, and the repository has still not had a fully successful run, while the failure rate and success rate are now half and half today. Todays run resulted in an unusually high Markdown usage indicator, with Markdown surpassing HTML. In reality, it is really only about halfway there or closer.

I put the workflow runs into 40 categories:

**2023, Wednesday, July 19th**

The workflow had a full success today, finishing within 5 hours, 39 minutes, and 56 seconds.

When it got to the 4 hour point, I feared it might just keep going to the 6 hour point and crash, or possibly just finish with bad results. This was a huge surprise. It finally had its first full success of the month, and additionally ran successfully for a 3rd day **and** brought the ratio of success/failure back to majority success. A triple win.

This was really exciting to see this tonight. I was starting to prepare for it to never run successfully this month. I have no idea why it worked so well, it just did. I am hoping for some more success this month.

**2023, Saturday, July 22nd**

The workflow had a failed run today, finishing within 0 hours, 44 minutes, and 02 seconds. It took 43 minutes and 1 second to find a runner, then failed in 1 minute and 1 second. The successes never last forever with this workflow, so this was to be expected. I was supposed to update this repository to reflect these changes the next day, but due to my 2023 July vacation, I held that off by 1 more day, so that I could have time to visit with family, and not do as much work.

**2023, Wednesday, July 26th**

The workflow had an unsuccessful run today, finishing within 0 hours, 01 minute, and 07 seconds. It broke a 3 day success streak, and started the 9th failure streak of the month. At the current rate, I am expecting at least 10 failure streaks for this month of just 31 days.

I put the workflow runs into 41 categories:

**2023, Saturday, July 29th**
 
The workflow had a fully successful run today, finishing within 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 45 seconds (although the run time was actually 5 hours, 33 minutes, and 35 seconds, it took 39 minutes and 10 seconds t start) this was the second fully successful run of the month, which was unexpected. I am getting increasingly worried that it is getting too complicated to run in 6 hours, as the workflow run time limit is close to being reached for each successful run.

I put the workflow runs into 41 categories:

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

***

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, May 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

***

### Accuracy issues

Something that recently roused[sic] my suspicion/caught my eye is that the workflow is not accurately reporting the total number of source repositories. On 2023, May 20th, it reported that I had `3,427` repositories with contributions, while at the time of the workflow run, I only had `3,391` source repositories, meaning it was off by `36`. That is a pretty notable margin of error. - Logged on 2023, Tuesday, May 23rd

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.

***

### Season 13 performance speculation

I have been beginning to suspect that a recent bug with the GitHub linguist in my Git-Templates repository is causing the workflow to perform badly this month (2023, July) as I feel the workflow may be scanning up to this repository, then getting stuck (this particular repository is reporting negative language usage, but the internals of the Linguist indicate that data is still being scanned correctly, the logic just isn't being processed correctly) I am wondering if this workflow reads the logic, and not the data. As of 2023, Saturday, July 15th, the workflow has not had a single fully successful run this month, and has had a very high failure rate.

On 2023, July 19th, the workflow had a full success. I am still unsure why it has been doing so poorly prior to this. I feel I can rule out Git-Templates now.

The performance has continued to wane, this full success only happened once, as of 2023, July 23rd.
