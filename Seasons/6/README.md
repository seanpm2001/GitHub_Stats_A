# Season 6

| :octocat: | Previous season [`5`](/Seasons/5/) | **Current season:** [`6`](/Seasons/6/) | Next season [`7`](/Seasons/7/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the sixth season (31 days, day 158-189) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires)

This season starts with 2022, Thursday, December 1st. It is expected to last until 2022, Saturday, December 31st.

For this season, I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

The process ran (somewhat) successfully today, finishing in 2 hours, 46 minutes, and 17 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. <!-- There was an umcommon `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today. I also discovered that the timezone for this process is 6 hours ahead of my own. !--> <!-- There was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> Despite the process running so much longer today, only 1000 repositories were scanned today. My recent uptick in Java usage is now showing up in the language statistics.

I put the workflow runs into 26 categories:

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today (3rd consecutive day of failure) failing in 1 minute and 50 seconds. There were some `aiohttp` errors today. There was also a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today. This error is starting to become common. <!-- There was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> No repositories were scanned today. I previously assumed that it failed because I was working while it was starting. That wasn't the case today. I am glad it at least failed when my last workflow run gave full results. I feel it has done something similar to this in the past, and has bounced back. However, if there isn't a successful run by 2022, Friday, December 9th, I will contact the author of the workflow.

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Access tokens

#### Access token for 2022 June (season 1)

The access token for this project was simply named `ACCESS_TOKEN` I don't have its URL on me, but I do have the configuration info for when I create a new one tomorrow (since the current one expires on 2022, Tuesday, July 12th)
