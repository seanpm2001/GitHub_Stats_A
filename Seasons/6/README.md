# Season 6

| :octocat: | Previous season [`5`](/Seasons/5/) | **Current season:** [`6`](/Seasons/6/) | Next season [`7`](/Seasons/7/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the sixth season (31 days, day 158-189) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires)

This season starts with 2022, Thursday, December 1st. It is expected to last until 2022, Saturday, December 31st.

For this season, I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, as the workflow was not operating correctly this month.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

The process ran (somewhat) successfully today, finishing in 2 hours, 46 minutes, and 17 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. <!-- There was an umcommon `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today. I also discovered that the timezone for this process is 6 hours ahead of my own. !--> <!-- There was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> Despite the process running so much longer today, only 1000 repositories were scanned today. My recent uptick in Java usage is now showing up in the language statistics.

I put the workflow runs into 26 categories:

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today (3rd consecutive day of failure) failing in 1 minute and 50 seconds. There were some `aiohttp` errors today. There was also a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today. This error is starting to become common. <!-- There was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> No repositories were scanned today. I previously assumed that it failed because I was working while it was starting. That wasn't the case today. I am glad it at least failed when my last workflow run gave full results. I feel it has done something similar to this in the past, and has bounced back. However, if there isn't a successful run by 2022, Friday, December 9th, I will contact the author of the workflow.

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today (4th consecutive day of failure) but it put up a good fight, failing in 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 40 seconds. There were thousands of `aiohttp` errors today. I knew something was really off when there were nearly 2000 errors within the first 20 minutes. There was also a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today as a cherry on top. This error is starting to become common. Additionally, the workflow had to back itself up before finishing, as something went really wrong at the end. <!-- There was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> No repositories were scanned today. I feel it has done something similar to this in the past, and has bounced back. However, if there isn't a successful run by 2022, Friday, December 9th, I will contact the author of the workflow.

The process ran unsuccessfully today, faling within 0 hours, 0 minutes and 54 seconds. <!-- There was a  `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today. This error is starting to become common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence. !--> there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. The failure may have been my fault this time, as I was activly checking to see if the workload had started, and accidentally made a push about 3 seconds after it started, which may have caused the failure. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. No repositories were scanned today. For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

I put the workflow runs into 27 categories:

The process finished within 1 hour, 51 minutes and 17 seconds. <!-- There was a  `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today.

SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

**2022, Monday, December 19th**

The process ran (somewhat) successfully today, getting a 2 consecutive day streak going for the first time in weeks, but also being a massive disappointment at the same time. The process finished within 5 hours, 28 minutes and 29 seconds. Even with all that time, it didn't even scan half of my repositories. <!-- There was a  `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today. This error is starting to become common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence. !--> <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. The failure may have been my fault this time, as I was slightly busy at the time that the workflow started. !--> There were some `aiohttp` errors today. Only 1000 repositories were scanned today. I am frustrated by the poor results over nearly 5 and a half hours, but am still glad it at least succeeded. Assembly has recently surpassed Java for the top 10 slots on off days, due to usage in recent Android x64 development. Today for some reason, all 3 of the recent languages that have been increasing in use (Java, Assembly, and JSON) all appeared on the list. SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.

I really felt like it was going to be a full success today, given how long it took, but no. This workflow seems completely unpredictable now.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

The process ran unsuccessfully again today, going into day 2 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 1 minutes and 55 seconds. There was a  `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error today. This error is starting to become common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence. <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. The failure may have been my fault this time, as I was slightly busy at the time that the workflow started. !--> Additionally, there were some `aiohttp` errors today. No repositories were scanned today. <!-- Assembly has surpassed Java for the top 10 slots on off days, due to usage in recent Android x64 development. Today for some reason, all 3 of the recent languages that have been increasing in use (Java, Assembly, and JSON) all appeared on the list, additionally, Ruby also appeared on the list. SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.!-->

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

The process ran unsuccessfully again today, going into day 3 of a failure streak. The process failed within 4 hours, 43 minutes and 44 seconds. The workflow spit out thousands of `aiohttp` errors. I knew early on that it may have not succeeded, but I decided to let it keep going to see if it would, as I can’t be sure due to what has been going on lately. After 4 hours, 43 minutes, and 44 seconds, it failed, with over 16000 errors, followed by a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error. This error is starting to become common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence. <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully.

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today, going into day 7 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 58 minutes and 58 seconds.

I plan to contact [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jstrieb/) some time in 2023, January. The workflow has never done so poorly before.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

**2022, Wednesday, December 28th**

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today, going into day 8 of a failure streak. The process failed within 2 hours, 56 minutes and 43 seconds. It tried to run today, but there were too many (near or more than 10000) `aiohttp` errors, followed by a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error. This error is starting to become very common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence.

I plan to contact [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jstrieb/) some time in 2023, January. The workflow has never done so poorly before.

I was additionally upset today, as for most of the day, my other GitHub stats were having problems, and I didn't have the time or resources to set up a Vercel instance to get them to work. Luckily, they self-recovered. This workflow hasn't.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

**2022, Thursday, December 29th**

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today, going into day 9 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 0 minutes and 56 seconds. It tried to run today, but there were a couple `aiohttp` errors, followed by a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error. This error is starting to become very common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence.

Additionally, there was an error while handling the error, which was new. `During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:` followed by another `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error, and several `aiohttp failed for GraphQL query` errors, before it finally ended with `Error: Process completed with exit code 1.`

I plan to contact [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jstrieb/) some time in 2023, January. The workflow has never done so poorly before.

I have a feeling that this is going to last the rest of the month. There are still 2 days left, hopefully it can have 1 final success.

I didn't update my stats repository for 4 days. Today is the first time in 4 days that I updated it. I also learned today that the workflow in the `post Run actions checkout` phase has always been normal, at least for errored days.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Errors since 2022 October 13th

These errors have been present on all runs since 2022, October 13th

### Access tokens

#### Access token for 2022 June (season 1)

The access token for this project was simply named `ACCESS_TOKEN` I don't have its URL on me, but I do have the configuration info for when I create a new one tomorrow (since the current one expires on 2022, Tuesday, July 12th)

<details open><summary><p><b>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the access token screenshot for season 1]</b></p></summary>

![/Seasons/1/ACCESS_TOKEN/ACCESS_TOKEN_2022June_Config.png](/Seasons/1/ACCESS_TOKEN/ACCESS_TOKEN_2022June_Config.png)

</details>

You can use this as a reference for setting up the project.

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022 July 12th before 2:35 pm PST.

#### Access token for 2022 September (season 3)

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022, August 26th

#### Access token for 2022 September (season 4)

#### Access token for 2022 October and November (season 5)

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022, October 25th. For this season, I am changing things up for the range. I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022, December 1st. I am continuing on with the plan of having the token expire on the first day of each month, so that it is also renewed on the first day of each month.
