 <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully.

Today for some reason, all 3 of the recent languages that have been increasing in use (Java, Assembly, and JSON) all appeared on the list, additionally, Ruby also appeared on the list. SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.!-->

**2023, Thursday, June 1st**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 37 minutes and 0 seconds, with incomplete data. It is still better than nothing, and it is good to start the month with a successful run.

I put the workflow runs into 38 categories:

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 46 minutes and 52 seconds, with incomplete data. It is still better than nothing. On a side note, I did my monthly update to the partial success, failure, and full success compilation documents within the GitHub_Stats_A project today.

**2023, Saturday, June 3rd**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 2 hours, 44 minutes and 57 seconds, with incomplete data. It is still better than nothing. It took a long time for these results, I expected more. I feel I have found a strategy in guaranteeing workflow success, which is to not do any commits on GitHub for 1.6 hours before the workflow starts, and for 5 minutes after the workflow starts. Things may change again, and I may not be able to stay consistent with this, so failure is still possible.

I put the workflow runs into 38 categories:

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 3 hours, 2 minutes and 47 seconds, with incomplete data. It is still better than nothing. I am hoping to have a full success soon.

I put the workflow runs into 38 categories:

**2023, Tuesday, June 6th**

The workflow had a full success today, finishing within 5 hours, 43 minutes and 2 seconds, with incomplete data. I am happy to have a full success, but I am getting increasingly worried, as it is really close to hitting the 6 hour workflow limit (it was only 1,018 seconds (16 minutes, 58 seconds) from the 6 hour limit)

I put the workflow runs into 38 categories:

**2023, Thursday, June 8th**

The workflow had an unsuccessful day today, failing within 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 59 seconds. It claims `set changed size during iteration` but that seems false, as I wasn't on GitHub for over 2 hours prior to the workflow starting. It ended an 11 day consecutive streak. With GitHub removing useful error messages since the 2023 May 9th update, I feel there is something that isn't being told to me here.

**2023, Saturday, June 10th**

The workflow had a full success today, finishing within 5 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds (although there was a 30 minute and 45 second delay for the workflow to start, so the total time came out to 6 hours, 0 minutes, and 51 seconds) there were some `aiohttp` errors, but the workflow succeeded anyways.

I put the workflow runs into 39 categories:

The workflow had a full success today on its 1 year anniversary, finishing within 5 hours, 04 minutes, and 12 seconds. I expected it to have a partial success or outright failure. I am glad it succeeded on its 1 year anniversary. It is crazy how it has already been 1 year since I first started using this workflow.

The workflow had a full success today for a second consecutive day, which for me was overshadowed by my laptop having a fatal kernel panic, and now refusing to turn on at all (not even enough for me to run the `fsck` command) and having to switch back to my XPS 13. The workflow finished within 5 hours, 11 minutes, and 43 seconds.

The workflow had a partial success today. The workflow finished within 1 hour, 38 minutes, and 1 second. It is still better than nothing.

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

***

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, May 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

***

### Accuracy issues

Something that recently roused[sic] my suspicion/caught my eye is that the workflow is not accurately reporting the total number of source repositories. On 2023, May 20th, it reported that I had `3,427` repositories with contributions, while at the time of the workflow run, I only had `3,391` source repositories, meaning it was off by `36`. That is a pretty notable margin of error. - Logged on 2023, Tuesday, May 23rd

***

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.
