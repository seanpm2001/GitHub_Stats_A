# Season 8

| :octocat: | Previous season [`7`](/Seasons/7/) | **Current season:** [`8`](/Seasons/8/) | Next season [`9`](/Seasons/89) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the eighth season (28 days, day 221-249) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires)

This season starts with 2023, Wednesday, February 1st. It is expected to last until 2023, Thursday, February 28th.

For this season, I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

**2023, Wednesday, February 1st**

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 43 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 0 minutes and 48 seconds.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being. It is being partially maintained, in the hope that it might work again, and that a fix can be made. It isn't too much work to maintain.

The patch reduced some errors, but ultimately did not fix the workflow as of yet.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

I put the workflow runs into 28 categories:

**2023, Monday, February 6th**

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 48 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 0 minutes and 45 seconds.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being. It is being partially maintained, in the hope that it might work again, and that a fix can be made. It isn't too much work to maintain. It has not been touched in 6 days.

The patch reduced some errors, but ultimately did not fix the workflow as of yet.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

I put the workflow runs into 28 categories:

**2023, Friday, February 10th**

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 52 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 14 minutes and 30 seconds. The workflow was unable to start to even fail today, there was nearly 14 full minutes of a wait for a runner to start.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being. It is being partially maintained, in the hope that it might work again, and that a fix can be made. It isn't too much work to maintain. It has not been touched in 10 days.

The patch reduced some errors, but ultimately did not fix the workflow as of yet.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate has stayed at 100% for over a month.

**2023, Saturday, February 11th**

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 53 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 22 minutes and 46 seconds. The workflow was unable to start to even fail today, there was nearly 22 full minutes of a wait for a runner to start.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being. It is being partially maintained, in the hope that it might work again, and that a fix can be made. It isn't too much work to maintain. It has not been touched in 11 days.

The patch reduced some errors, but ultimately did not fix the workflow as of yet.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate has stayed at 100% for over a month.

I put the workflow runs into 28 categories:

**2023, Thursday, February 16th**

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 58 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 1 minute and 2 seconds.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being. It is being partially maintained, in the hope that it might work again, and that a fix can be made. It isn't too much work to maintain. I finally got back to this project today, the logs didn't expire, and I finished 3 projects I have been procrastinating on.

The patch reduced some errors, but ultimately did not fix the workflow as of yet.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate has stayed at 100% for over a month.

I put the workflow runs into 28 categories:

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 59 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 1 minute and 44 seconds.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being. It is being partially maintained, in the hope that it might work again, and that a fix can be made. It isn't too much work to maintain. The workflow would not have succeeded regardless today, due to GitHub suffering a 2.5+ hour outage.

The patch reduced some errors, but ultimately did not fix the workflow as of yet.

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 61 of a failure streak. The process failed within 6 hours, 1 minute and 34 seconds. There was something very surprising today: the process ran for longer than 2 minutes. It threw several thousand AIOHTTP errors, but it didn't fail quickly. It hasn't done this good in 61 days. GitHub eventually timed out due to a 360 minute limit for workflows, and I was wondering if this limit wasn't there, how long it would have taken, and if it could have succeeded. I feel it likely had a recursive break somewhere, and would never end, so the 360 minute limit was a good thing. I had to leave the workflow running overnight (well, up until near midnight, but my laptop had been shut down for more than an hour by the time it failed) I would have worked on this repository today if it would have succeeded before 9:30 pm. Instead, I updated my GitHub starlist repository.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being.

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 62 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 8 minute and 1 seconds. There was a wait for it to find a runner, then once it started, it failed within 2 minutes. So I guess things are back to "normal" here. I still have hope that it may succeed again one day, last night was proof that there is still a chance.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being.

**2023, Tuesday, February 21st**

The process ran unsuccessfully as usual today, going into day 63 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 0 minutes and 57 seconds, although it took over an hour to start up, as there was a wait for it to find a runner.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. I have pretty much given up on the project for the time being. It is being partially maintained, in the hope that it might work again, and that a fix can be made. It isn't too much work to maintain.

The patch reduced some errors, but ultimately did not fix the workflow as of yet.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate has stayed at 100% for over a month.

I put the workflow runs into 30 categories:

The process actually ran successfully today, ending a 63 day failure streak. I have no idea why it started working again. The process succeeded within 2 hours, 16 minutes and 4 seconds. The workflow success was one of the highlights of my day today.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate has stayed at 100% for over a month.

**2023, Tuesday, February 28th**

The process ran successfully today, succeeding within 4 hours, 36 minutes and 14 seconds.

I have been trying to work on updating this repository every 2 days, but I have been failing. I was going to update the repository today as a last day of the month update, but the workflow ran too long, and I had to it the next day. The workflow did have a 100% success for the last day of the month. Hopefully it can remain stable into season 9.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**
