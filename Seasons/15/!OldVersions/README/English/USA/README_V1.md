### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

***

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, May 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

***

### Accuracy issues

Something that recently roused[sic] my suspicion/caught my eye is that the workflow is not accurately reporting the total number of source repositories. On 2023, May 20th, it reported that I had `3,427` repositories with contributions, while at the time of the workflow run, I only had `3,391` source repositories, meaning it was off by `36`. That is a pretty notable margin of error. - Logged on 2023, Tuesday, May 23rd

***

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.

***

### Season 13 performance speculation

I have been beginning to suspect that a recent bug with the GitHub linguist in my Git-Templates repository is causing the workflow to perform badly this month (2023, July) as I feel the workflow may be scanning up to this repository, then getting stuck (this particular repository is reporting negative language usage, but the internals of the Linguist indicate that data is still being scanned correctly, the logic just isn't being processed correctly) I am wondering if this workflow reads the logic, and not the data. As of 2023, Saturday, July 15th, the workflow has not had a single fully successful run this month, and has had a very high failure rate.

On 2023, July 19th, the workflow had a full success. I am still unsure why it has been doing so poorly prior to this. I feel I can rule out Git-Templates now.

The performance has continued to wane, this full success only happened once, as of 2023, July 23rd.

***

### Season 14 and limitations of the workflow

On 2023, Thursday, August 17th, the workflow failed because it hit the 6 hour workflow limit. This was the second time it has done this to date. The next day, it did it again. I am feeling that my GitHub profile now takes more than 6 hours to scan, and that partial successes are in this projects future. It would have been nice to be able to keep my organizations, as then I could split the repositories up, and this wouldn't be a problem. My profile will continue to grow, and this workflow doesn't seem like it will be able to keep up anymore.

#### Season 15 update

To my surprise, it had 1 more fully successful run, with less than 5 minutes remaining
