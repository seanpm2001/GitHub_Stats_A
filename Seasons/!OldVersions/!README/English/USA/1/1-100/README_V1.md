# Seanpm2001 Statistics

## GitHub Statistics Part A

### Seasons overview

#### What is a season?

A season is a time period in which workflow statistics run daily, and data is collected. Seasons typically last for 30 days, but some seasons may last longer (the only example being season 5, which was extended to let season 6 start on the first day of the month)

##### Seasons

| `S02` | [`/Seasons/2/`](/Seasons/2/) | 2022, July 12th to 2022, August 10th | Season heavily interrupted due to my GitHub account being flagged |
| `S03` | [`/Seasons/3/`](/Seasons/3/) | 2022, August 11th to 2022, September 25th | Season extended due to GitHub account being flagged, and renewal not happening in time, season resumed on 2022, August 26th |

| `S05` | [`/Seasons/5/`](/Seasons/5/) | 2022, October 25th to 2022, November 30th | Extended by 6 days to let the next season start on the first day of the month |
| `S06` | [`Coming soon`](/Seasons/) | TBD | TBD |

##### Compilation

Seasons currently are exported into SVG image files that contain animations. It has proven to be a notable strain on the CPU of a computer for a single season, but the question of a compilation has not been thrown out.

<!-- There is currently a planned season compilation, but precautions are going to need to be taken before it can be created. !-->

The season compilation can be found [`Here`](/Seasons/!Compilation/) be wary of system stability.
