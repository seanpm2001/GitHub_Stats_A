 <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully.

Today for some reason, all 3 of the recent languages that have been increasing in use (Java, Assembly, and JSON) all appeared on the list, additionally, Ruby also appeared on the list. SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.!-->

**2023, Saturday, April 1st**

The process did not run today, as my access token had to be renewed, and I didn't remember to turn the workflow back on until after 5:00 pm. The workflow may have decided that it was too late in the day to attempt to run, so it never ran today on its own. I attempted to run it manually, but feared that it would start on its own after I went to sleep, and that it would have a problem with 2 workflow runs going at once, so I canceled my run.

<!-- The process ran successfully today, succeeding within 4 hours, 36 minutes and 14 seconds. !-->

I put the workflow runs into 33 categories:

The workflow failed today. It took over 2 hours to find a host running Ubuntu, then failed within 2 minutes with the `set changed size during iteration` error. The workflow ran for a total of 2 hours, 2 minutes, and 7 seconds.

I put the workflow runs into 36 categories:

The workflow failed again today, failing within 0 minutes and 54 seconds with a `set changed size during iteration` error, after over 15 minutes of trying to find a runner (overall total: 16 minutes and 22 seconds) I am fine with the failure, now there is a new record for a failure streak this month. I will need to adjust my workflow to mitigate this error.

**2023, Monday, April 24th**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 2 hours, 31 minutes and 47 seconds. Although it did succeed, it did very poorly. It scanned less than 33% of my source repositories, and has highly incomplete data. I didn't know that 100 repositories could make such a difference. It feels like a failure that it gave such poor results.

I put the workflow runs into 36 categories:

**2023, Tuesday, April 25th**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 51 minutes and 34 seconds. Although it did succeed, it did very poorly. It scanned less than 33% of my source repositories, and has highly incomplete data. I am glad it is succeeding instead of failing, but these results are embarrassing. It did scan 1,100 repositories though, I didn't notice at first due to the language section being so off.

Unusual full success: Complete data, except for repository views, which entered as 0
Possibly due to the workflow running after midnight, when the access token expired
I felt that it might fail due to the access token expiring, but it didn't.

**2023, Sunday, April 30th**

The workflow had an unusual full success today, finishing within 5 hours, 52 minutes and 38 seconds. I was on vacation, so there wasn't much new data to work with. The workflow ran after midnight, which is when the access token expired. I expected it to completely fail, but it didn't. The one quirk was that it didn't parse repository view data, but it got everything else.

I put the workflow runs into 36 categories:

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, April 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

***

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.
