## GitHub Statistics Part A

### Seasons overview

#### What is a season?

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

A season is a time period in which workflow statistics run daily, and data is collected. Seasons typically last for 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, but some seasons may last longer (the only example being season 5, which was extended to let season 6 start on the first day of the month)

##### Compilation

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Seasons currently are exported into SVG image files that contain animations. It has proven to be a notable strain on the CPU of a computer for a single season, but the question of a compilation has not been thrown out.

<!-- There is currently a planned season compilation, but precautions are going to need to be taken before it can be created. !-->

The season compilation can be found [`Here`](/Seasons/!Compilation/) be wary of system stability.

Safety precautions were added on 2022, December 7th and December 8th to make it require confirmation to load the README file from normal navigation. On 2022, December 7th, the folders were moved inwards 1 directory, and daily notes were added. On 2022, December 8th, a safe browsing section was added to the outer `README` allowing the navigation of the folders contents without opening it, and giving information on if the target file/folder is safe or not.
