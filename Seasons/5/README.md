# Season 5

| :octocat: | Previous season [`4`](/Seasons/4/) | **Current season:** [`5`](/Seasons/5/) | Next season [`6`](/Seasons/6/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the fifth season (37 days, day 121-157) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires)

This season starts with 2022, Tuesday, October 25th. It is expected to last until 2022, Wednesday, November 30th.

For this season, I am changing things up for the range. I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

**2022 October 25th**

The process ran somewhat successfully today, finishing in 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 48 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> only 900 repositories were scanned today.

The `lines of code changed` line was back to normal today, which I am glad to see. I am still hoping for a full successful run soon.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R1200` - _Partial success, with 1200-1299 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1300` - _Partial success, with 1300-1399 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `R1400` - _Partial success, with 1400-1499 out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 5:** `R1500` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 6:** `R1600` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 7:** `R1700` - _Moderate success, with 1500-1599 or more out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 8:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 1 day.

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Errors since 2022 October 13th

These errors have been present on all runs since 2022, October 13th
