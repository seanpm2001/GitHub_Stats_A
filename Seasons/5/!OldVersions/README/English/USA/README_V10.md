# Season 5

| :octocat: | Previous season [`4`](/Seasons/4/) | **Current season:** [`5`](/Seasons/5/) | Next season [`6`](/Seasons/6/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the fifth season (37 days, day 121-157) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires)

This season starts with 2022, Tuesday, October 25th. It is expected to last until 2022, Wednesday, November 30th.

For this season, I am changing things up for the range. I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

The process ran somewhat successfully today, finishing in 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 48 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> only 900 repositories were scanned today.

The `lines of code changed` line was back to normal today, which I am glad to see. I am still hoping for a full successful run soon.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_

**2022 October 27th**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, failing within 1 minute and 2s. There were no `aiohttp` errors today.  there was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. I wasn't doing anything on GitHub within 15 minutes of the process starting and crashing, I was using GIMP. After it has these failures, it usually behaves differently when it starts to run successfully again. Hopefully there will be a 100% successful workflow run soon.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Access tokens

#### Access token for 2022 June (season 1)

The access token for this project was simply named `ACCESS_TOKEN` I don't have its URL on me, but I do have the configuration info for when I create a new one tomorrow (since the current one expires on 2022, Tuesday, July 12th)

![/Seasons/1/ACCESS_TOKEN/ACCESS_TOKEN_2022June_Config.png](/Seasons/1/ACCESS_TOKEN/ACCESS_TOKEN_2022June_Config.png)

You can use this as a reference for setting up the project.

#### Access token for 2022 September (season 3)

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022, August 26th

#### Access token for 2022 September (season 4)

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022, September 25th

#### Access token for 2022 October and November (season 5)
