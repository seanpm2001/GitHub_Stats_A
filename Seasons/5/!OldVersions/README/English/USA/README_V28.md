# Season 5

| :octocat: | Previous season [`4`](/Seasons/4/) | **Current season:** [`5`](/Seasons/5/) | Next season [`6`](/Seasons/6/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the fifth season (37 days, day 121-157) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires)

This season starts with 2022, Tuesday, October 25th. It is expected to last until 2022, Wednesday, November 30th.

For this season, I am changing things up for the range. I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

The process ran somewhat successfully today, finishing in 1 hour, 23 minutes, and 48 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> only 900 repositories were scanned today.

The `lines of code changed` line was back to normal today, which I am glad to see. I am still hoping for a full successful run soon.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R1100` - _Partial success, with 1100-1199 or less out of 1600+ repositories scanned/indexed_

**2022 October 27th**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, failing within 1 minute and 2s. There were no `aiohttp` errors today.  there was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. I wasn't doing anything on GitHub within 15 minutes of the process starting and crashing, I was using GIMP. After it has these failures, it usually behaves differently when it starts to run successfully again. Hopefully there will be a 100% successful workflow run soon.

I put the workflow runs into 9 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_

The process ran (somewhat) successfully today, finishing in 2 hours, 40 minutes, and 8 seconds. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. <!-- There was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> Only 1000 repositories were scanned today. The process started at 5:48 pm, the earliest it has ever started. This was likely because the program is based in a different time zone, and Daylight Savings Time just adjusted here (at 2:00 am, it went back to 1:00 am) it is so annoying.

I put the workflow runs into 14 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R900` - _Partial success, with 900-999 or less out of 2100+ repositories scanned/indexed_

The process ran (somewhat) successfully today, finishing in 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 11 seconds, although GitHub was acting weird yet again today, the page would not refresh on its own, AJAX did not seem to be functional for the workflow only, everything else is acting more functional (commit push times now refresh every second) This was unrelated to the workflow. There were no `aiohttp` errors today. <!-- There was a `size changed during iteration` error, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. !--> Only 900 repositories were scanned today. The `There were too many 202s. Data for this repository will be incomplete` error came back today. The workflow has been running successfully for 11 consecutive days, which is a new record.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Errors since 2022 October 13th

These errors have been present on all runs since 2022, October 13th

Additionally, these errors were present:

### Access tokens

#### Access token for 2022 June (season 1)

The access token for this project was simply named `ACCESS_TOKEN` I don't have its URL on me, but I do have the configuration info for when I create a new one tomorrow (since the current one expires on 2022, Tuesday, July 12th)

![/Seasons/1/ACCESS_TOKEN/ACCESS_TOKEN_2022June_Config.png](/Seasons/1/ACCESS_TOKEN/ACCESS_TOKEN_2022June_Config.png)

You can use this as a reference for setting up the project.

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022 July 12th before 2:35 pm PST.

#### Access token for 2022 September (season 3)

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022, August 26th

#### Access token for 2022 September (season 4)

The access token for this project was renewed on 2022, September 25th
