 <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. The failure may have been my fault this time, as I was slightly busy at the time that the workflow started. !--> <!-- Additionally, there were some `aiohttp` errors today. !-->  <!-- No repositories were scanned yet again today. <!-- Assembly has surpassed Java for the top 10 slots on off days, due to usage in recent Android x64 development. Today for some reason, all 3 of the recent languages that have been increasing in use (Java, Assembly, and JSON) all appeared on the list, additionally, Ruby also appeared on the list. SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.!-->

**2023, Wednesday, May 10th**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 45 minutes, and 58 seconds. I am surprised by how many consecutive successes the workflow is having. I would like it to have a full success soon though.

I put the workflow runs into 37 categories:

**2023, Thursday, May 11th**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 3 hours, 2 minutes, and 29 seconds. I am surprised by how many consecutive successes the workflow is having. I would like it to have a full success soon though. The recent slightly-higher success rate was good, but not worth waiting 3+ hours for 100 more repositories to be scanned.

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, May 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.
