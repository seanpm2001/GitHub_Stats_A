 <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. The failure may have been my fault this time, as I was slightly busy at the time that the workflow started. !--> <!-- Additionally, there were some `aiohttp` errors today. !-->  <!-- No repositories were scanned yet again today. <!-- Assembly has surpassed Java for the top 10 slots on off days, due to usage in recent Android x64 development. Today for some reason, all 3 of the recent languages that have been increasing in use (Java, Assembly, and JSON) all appeared on the list, additionally, Ruby also appeared on the list. SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.!-->

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 45 minutes, and 58 seconds. I am surprised by how many consecutive successes the workflow is having. I would like it to have a full success soon though.

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 3 hours, 2 minutes, and 29 seconds. I am surprised by how many consecutive successes the workflow is having. I would like it to have a full success soon though. The recent slightly-higher success rate was good, but not worth waiting 3+ hours for 100 more repositories to be scanned.

The workflow had a full success today, after 3 consecutive failures, finishing within 5 hours, 31 minutes, and 18 seconds. I am getting extremely worried about how close a full success is getting to 6 hours (the limit of a GitHub workflow) I really felt that it might not succeed tonight.

**2023, Sunday, May 21st**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 2 hours, 35 minutes and 28 seconds, with incomplete data. It is still better than nothing. For some reason, it felt like cheating having 2 complete successes in a row. If I was truly in control of this workflow, I would have made it have a full success every single day.

I put the workflow runs into 38 categories:

**2023, Tuesday, May 23rd**

The workflow had a partial success today, finishing within 1 hour, 28 minutes and 42 seconds, with incomplete data. It is still better than nothing. It performed badly, the worst it has done in months (besides failure) with only 900 repositories scanned.

I put the workflow runs into 38 categories:

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

***

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, May 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

***

### Accuracy issues

Something that recently roused[sic] my suspicion/caught my eye is that the workflow is not accurately reporting the total number of source repositories. On 2023, May 20th, it reported that I had `3,427` repositories with contributions, while at the time of the workflow run, I only had `3,391` source repositories, meaning it was off by `36`. That is a pretty notable margin of error. - Logged on 2023, Tuesday, May 23rd

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.
