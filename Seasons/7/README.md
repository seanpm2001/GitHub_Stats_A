# Season 7

| :octocat: | Previous season [`6`](/Seasons/6/) | **Current season:** [`7`](/Seasons/7/) | Next season [`8`](/Seasons/8/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the seventh season (31 days, day 190-220) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires)

This season starts with 2023, Sunday, January 1st. It is expected to last until 2023, Tuesday, January 31st.

For this season, I have chosen a custom range, instead of a 30 day range. From now on, I plan to have the access token expire on the first day of each month.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

**2023, Sunday, January 1st**

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today, going into day 12 of a failure streak, and starting the year with a failure. The process failed within 2 hours, 40 minutes and 11 seconds. There were thousands `aiohttp` errors, followed by a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error. This error is starting to become very common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence.

<!-- Additionally, there was an error while handling the error; `During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:` , followed by another error; `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error, and several `aiohttp failed for GraphQL query` errors, before it finally ended with `Error: Process completed with exit code 1.` !-->
 <!-- there was a `size changed during iteration` error today, which is the most common error I receive when the workflow runs unsuccessfully. The failure may have been my fault this time, as I was slightly busy at the time that the workflow started. !--> <!-- Additionally, there were some `aiohttp` errors today. !-->  No repositories were scanned yet again today. <!-- Assembly has surpassed Java for the top 10 slots on off days, due to usage in recent Android x64 development. Today for some reason, all 3 of the recent languages that have been increasing in use (Java, Assembly, and JSON) all appeared on the list, additionally, Ruby also appeared on the list. SVG usage has been stressing me out for a while, and I don't know how to fix it. There is a chance it may overtake both HTML and Python on both on and off days by late 2023 or 2024.!-->

I plan to contact [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jstrieb/) some time this month. The workflow has never done so poorly before.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

I put the workflow runs into 27 categories:

I plan to contact [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jstrieb/) some time this month. The workflow has never done so poorly before.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate is still well over 50%

I put the workflow runs into 28 categories:

The process ran unsuccessfully yet again today, going into day 17 of a failure streak. The process failed within 0 hours, 1 minute and 10 seconds. There were some `aiohttp` errors, followed by a `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error. This error is starting to become very common and may surpass the `Size changed during iteration` error in terms of occurrence.

Additionally, there was an error while handling the error; `During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:` , followed by another error; `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` error, and several `aiohttp failed for GraphQL query` errors, before it finally ended with `Error: Process completed with exit code 1.`

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

### Errors since 2022 October 13th

These errors have been present on all runs since 2022, October 13th
