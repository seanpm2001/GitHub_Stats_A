### 2022 June 12th to 2022 June 18th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 12th to 2022 June 18th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 12th**

The process ran for the first time, and picked up a lot. It still didn't feel complete. It threw over 2200 HTTP 202 errors, I noted in my README once it got to 500, which was far before it finished.

**2022 June 13th**

The process failed to run today, and I don't know why.

**2022 June 14th**

The process ran for the second time, and gave less accurate results. It is throwing a lot of HTTP 202 errors, over 2200 per run.

**2022 June 15th**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why.

**2022 June 16th**

The process ran today, and gave even less accurate results. This process is keeping me very distracted at 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm

**2022 June 17th**

The process ran for a second consecutive day today (a new record) and gave even less accurate results yet again.

**2022 June 18th**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why. The test process seems to be very flaky.

### 2022 June 19th to June 21st

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 19th to 2022 June 22nd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 19th**

Results became extremely accurate on 2022 June 19th, despite taking over 2 hours to compile the results.

**2022 June 20th**

Results are still extremely accurate as of 2022 June 20th, but they took over 30 minutes less time to compile.

**2022 June 21st**

Unfortunately, today, the process ran significantly faster, but gave ~40% less accurate results. I would rather the process take 2 hours and give good results, than for it to finish in an hour, 20 minutes, and give mediocre results. It still ran for a record 3 consecutive days though.

</details>

### 2022 June 22nd

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 22nd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 22nd**

The results were disappointing again today, as the process finished in only 1 hour and 20 minutes. The results are slightly more accurate than yesterday, but are still over 40% inaccurate. It is better than nothing, this was its 4th consecutive day, a new record.

</details>

### 2022 June 23rd

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 23rd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 23rd**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why. The consecutive streak ended with 4 days.

</details>

### 2022 June 24th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 24th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 24th**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why. I am starting to suspect it is because I am making commits as the project is starting. I am thinking that there is a 5-20 minute time period starting with the start of the workflow run, where you can't do anything on GitHub, or the process will fail. I am not entirely sure, however. The consecutive error streak is now at 2 days.

</details>

### 2022 June 25th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 25th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 25th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave inaccurate results, as it finished in only 1 hour and 20 minutes. I think it worked today because I wasn't on GitHub when it started, until it finished.

</details>

### 2022 June 26th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 26th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 26th**

The process failed to run today, and I don't know why. My suspicion from [2022 June 24th](#2022-June-24th) seems to be false, as I wasn't on GitHub for over an hour before the process started, and it started earlier than normal today (before 7:00 pm PST) yet still failed in less than 5 minutes.

</details>

### Overall overview

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Overall overview notes section</b></p></summary>

Results for 2022 June 20th are still the most accurate to date. All other results not from 2022 June 20th or 2022 June 21st are over 40% inaccurate.

The process failed to run on 2022 June 23rd. It has not ran successfully since (as of 2022, June 24th)
