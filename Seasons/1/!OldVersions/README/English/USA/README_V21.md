### 2022 June 12th to 2022 June 18th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 12th to 2022 June 18th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 12th**

The process ran for the first time, and picked up a lot. It still didn't feel complete. It threw over 2200 HTTP 202 errors, I noted in my README once it got to 500, which was far before it finished.

**2022 June 13th**

The process failed to run today, and I don't know why.

**2022 June 14th**

The process ran for the second time, and gave less accurate results. It is throwing a lot of HTTP 202 errors, over 2200 per run.

**2022 June 15th**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why.

**2022 June 16th**

The process ran today, and gave even less accurate results. This process is keeping me very distracted at 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm

**2022 June 17th**

The process ran for a second consecutive day today (a new record) and gave even less accurate results yet again.

**2022 June 18th**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why. The test process seems to be very flaky.

### 2022 June 19th to June 21st

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 19th to 2022 June 22nd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 19th**

Results became extremely accurate on 2022 June 19th, despite taking over 2 hours to compile the results.

**2022 June 20th**

Results are still extremely accurate as of 2022 June 20th, but they took over 30 minutes less time to compile.

**2022 June 21st**

Unfortunately, today, the process ran significantly faster, but gave ~40% less accurate results. I would rather the process take 2 hours and give good results, than for it to finish in an hour, 20 minutes, and give mediocre results. It still ran for a record 3 consecutive days though.

</details>

### 2022 June 22nd

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 22nd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 22nd**

The results were disappointing again today, as the process finished in only 1 hour and 20 minutes. The results are slightly more accurate than yesterday, but are still over 40% inaccurate. It is better than nothing, this was its 4th consecutive day, a new record.

</details>

### 2022 June 23rd

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 23rd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 23rd**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why. The consecutive streak ended with 4 days.

</details>

### 2022 June 24th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 24th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 24th**

The process failed to run again today, and I don't know why. I am starting to suspect it is because I am making commits as the project is starting. I am thinking that there is a 5-20 minute time period starting with the start of the workflow run, where you can't do anything on GitHub, or the process will fail. I am not entirely sure, however. The consecutive error streak is now at 2 days.

</details>

### 2022 June 25th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 25th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 25th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave inaccurate results, as it finished in only 1 hour and 20 minutes. I think it worked today because I wasn't on GitHub when it started, until it finished.

</details>

### 2022 June 26th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 26th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 26th**

The process failed to run today, and I don't know why. My suspicion from [2022 June 24th](#2022-June-24th) seems to be false, as I wasn't on GitHub for over an hour before the process started, and it started earlier than normal today (before 7:00 pm PST) yet still failed in less than 5 minutes.

### 2022 June 27th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 27th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 27th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave inaccurate results, as it finished in only 1 hour and 20 minutes. The results are less accurate than 2022 June 25th.

</details>

### 2022 June 28th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 28th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 28th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave the most accurate results to date (on the overview, I am not so sure on the language list, but it was still a gigantic improvement over yesterday) it finished in a little under 2 hours today, and started much later than normal. 

</details>

### 2022 June 29th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 29th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 29th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave extremely accurate results to date again (as it added data from the past 24 hours to the overview) (on the overview, I am not so sure on the language list) it finished in a little under 2 hours today, but had a glitch where the workflow said it was done and had already pushed to the repository, but still took an extra 5 minutes. 

</details>

### 2022 June 30th

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 June 30th notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 June 30th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave poor inaccurate results to end the month. It finished in an hour and 20 minutes today.

</details>

</details>

### 2022 July 1st

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 July 1st notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 July 1st**

The process ran successfully today, and gave poor inaccurate results to start the month. It finished in an hour and 20 minutes today. It still ran for a record 5 consecutive days.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (not my handle) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly.

</details>

### 2022 July 2nd

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 July 2nd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 July 2nd**

The process ran successfully today, and gave extremely accurate results. The total lines of code changed has now exceeded 100.1 million. This was also the 6th consecutive day on which the process successfully ran, a record.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (not my handle) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly.

</details>

### 2022 July 3rd

<details open><summary><p lang="en"><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the 2022 July 2nd notes section</b></p></summary>

**2022 July 3rd**

The process ran successfully today, and gave inaccurate results. This was also the 7th consecutive day on which the process successfully ran, a record.

I forgot to mention that yesterday, it got stuck on "cleaning up orphan processes" in the end, even after the images were generated and pushed to the main branch. The thing that stood out today was that the process didn't start until 7:32 pm.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2) (not my handle, seanpm2001) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly.

### 2022 July 4th

</details>

**2022 July 4th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave inaccurate results again. This was also the 8th consecutive day on which the process successfully ran, a record.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly.

</details>

### 2022 July 5th

</details>

**2022 July 5th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave extremely inaccurate results. This was also the 9th consecutive day on which the process successfully ran, a record.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. The process also started at its latest point ever today (7:36 pm PST)

</details>

### 2022 July 6th

</details>

**2022 July 6th**

The process ran successfully today, and gave extremely inaccurate results. This was also the 10th consecutive day on which the process successfully ran, a record.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. The process also started very late today (at 7:26 pm PST)

</details>

### 2022 July 7th

</details>

**2022 July 7th**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, and broke its 10 consecutive day streak. I wasn't using GitHub 5 minutes before or after the run started, so I don't know why it got interrupted.

I have to decide whether I want to renew this process in the next 3-4 days, this doesn't hurt the decision, as it has been running poorly anyways, it is fine to crash every once in a while (it is expected for this process) and there is no other known way of accurately getting this data.

### 2022 July 8th

</details>

**2022 July 8th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave poor results. This was its first consecutive day of running again.

I am now putting the run into 4 categories:

Category 0: Complete failure - The process did not run

Category 1: R800 - Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned

Category 2: R900 - Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned

Category 3: Complete success - The process ran and gave accurate results

Today was a category 2 day.

I have to decide whether I want to renew this process in the next 3-4 days, currently, I am in favor of renewal, as there is no other known way of accurately getting this data.

### 2022 July 9th

</details>

**2022 July 9th**

The process ran successfully today, but gave poor results. This was its second consecutive day of running again.

I put the workflow runs into 4 categories:

Category 0: Complete failure - The process did not run

Category 1: R800 - Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned

Category 2: R900 - Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned

Category 3: Complete success - The process ran and gave accurate results

Today was a category 2 day.

I have to decide whether I want to renew this process in the next 2-3 days, currently, I am in favor of renewal, as there is no other known way of accurately getting this data.

Today, Ruby dropped out of the list, and was replaced by Swift. I also forgot to mention that a few days ago, Pony was put onto the list, while Scala dropped out. This was done, as I was importing the Swift implementation into WacOS, so it is a bit unfair at the moment. I plan to get Ruby back on the top 15, and drop Pony out at some point, as it is only used on 3 repositories.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly.
