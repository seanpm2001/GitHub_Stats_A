Results became extremely accurate on 2022 June 19th, despite taking over 2 hours to compile the results. They are still extremely accurate as of 2022 June 20th, and took over 30 minutes less time to compile.

Unfortunately, the next day, the process ran significantly faster, but gave ~40% less accurate results. I would rather the process take 2 hours and give good results, than for it to finish in an hour, 20 minutes, and give mediocre results. It still ran for a record 3 consecutive days though.
