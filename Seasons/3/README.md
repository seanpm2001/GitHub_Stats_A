# Season 3

| :octocat: | Previous season [`2`](/Seasons/2/) | **Current season:** [`3`](/Seasons/3/) | Next season [`4`](/Seasons/4/) | :octocat: |
|---|---|---|---|---|

This is an oveview of the third season (30 days, day 61-90) of using this tool (until the Personal Access Token expires) this season may last longer, as the access token couldn't be renewed on 2022 August 10th/11th.

This season starts with 2022, Thursday, August 11th. It may last more than 30 days, as the generation hasn't started yet.

<!-- A large segment (well over half) of this season contains no data, due to my GitHub account being flagged for 23 days and counting. !-->

**2022 August ?th**

The process ran unsuccessfully today, failing within 3 minutes, and breaking its 1 day consecutive streak.

I put the workflow runs into 5 categories:

- **Category 0:** `Complete failure` - _The process did not run_
- **Category 1:** `R0800` - _Partial success, with 800 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 2:** `R0900` - _Partial success, with 900 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 3:** `R1000` - _Moderate success, with 1000 out of 1500+ repositories scanned/indexed_
- **Category 4:** `Complete success` - _The process ran and gave accurate results_

Today was a category 0 day.

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed.

For this repository, I am now including error dumps in Python traceback format (`*.pytb`) which will still be viewable as plain text through `README.pytb` files.

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count.

**2022 August 11th**

My GitHub account was still suspended today (day 24, or 3 weeks, 3 days) so the process couldn't run. That is the least of my problems, this has caused me an unimaginable amount of stress and fear for several days now, but has been calm since. I am still extremely disappointed and a bit frustrated each day I log on to find that I am still flagged. I recently got a response, but now I had to do the hard thing and delete all my organizations, a huge disappointment to me, and the most painful thing this year. Once this is done, the next appeal will likely go through.

Unfortunately, another fork got thrown in the road, GitHub is refusing to delete my organizations, and also is refusing to let me delete my organizations. There is probably some sneaky workaround, but I am completely stumped now. Update: they unlocked the fork option after my request was rejected. Yesterday, I deleted 140 organizations (14%) on 2022, August 5th, I deleted another 80 (totaling 22% deleted) on 2022 August 6th, and another 60 (totaling 28% deleted) on 2022 August 7th. it is going to take me at least a week to delete all of them. I expect to be done by 2022, Tuesday, August 16th, but I likely won't have my account back on the same day.

I am starting to fear that I won't have my account back by 2022, August 10th, and that the access token will expire before I can renew it. On 2022, August 2nd, it reached the point where an entire half of the season does not have data, as my account was flagged.

Today, the fear came true. Season 2 has ended, with no data for 23 days out of 30 (76.66% of the time) I am unsure how renewal will work. Season 3 has started today, but currently contains no data.
