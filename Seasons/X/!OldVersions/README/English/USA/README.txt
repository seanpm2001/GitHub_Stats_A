### YYYY, DoW, Month 1st

<!--
The process ran successfully today, succeeding within 4 hours, 36 minutes and 14 seconds.

I have been trying to work on updating this repository every 2 days, but I have been failing. I was going to update the repository today as a last day of the month update, but the workflow ran too long, and I had to it the next day. The workflow did have a 100% success for the last day of the month. Hopefully it can remain stable into season 9.

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on YYYY, DoW, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.

For the meantime, when the workflow has a 100% success, it will be counted as equivalent to 2 days of partial success. This month really has not been going well. The failure rate has stayed at 100% for over a month.

I put the workflow runs into 33 categories:

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**
