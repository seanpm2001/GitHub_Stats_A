**2023, Saturday, August 5th**

The workflow had a partial success yet again today, finishing within 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 39 seconds, but only scanned 800 repositories. This month is starting to not go well because of this. Sure, there is still a 100% success rate 5 days in, but these successes aren't very meaningful, when they capture less than 20% of the data.

I put the workflow runs into 41 categories:

**2023, Sunday, August 6th**

The workflow had a failed run today, failing after 6 hours, 00 minutes, and 24 seconds, after it hit a workflow limit of 6 hours (although technically, it didn't run for a full 6 hours, as it was off by 6 seconds (5 hours 59 minutes, and 54 seconds) it doesn't matter anyways. Either my workflow was too big, or it got stuck on something, and couldn't finish in 6 hours. This is the first failure of the month.

**2023, Wednesday, August 9th**

The workflow had a full success today, finishing within 5 hours, 41 minutes, and 03 seconds. I am now really worried that full success runs won't be possible soon, as the last run that took close to this long may not have been stuck. Right now, there is only a 18 minute and 57 second gap between a workflow fully succeeding, and a workflow hitting the time limit. For now, I am glad that this month is going so well, and for there to be another full success.

I put the workflow runs into 41 categories:

**2023, Thursday, August 17th**

The workflow had an unsuccessful run today, failing within 6 hours, 00 minutes, and 26 seconds. I have a feeling that the workflow is no longer capable of doing fully successful runs, as this is the second time this month it failed due to running out of time. It appears that my profile takes more than 6 hours to scan.

I put the workflow runs into 41 categories:

**2023, Saturday, August 19th**

The workflow had another unsuccessful run today, although this time, it didn't try that hard. It failed within 0 hours, 01 minute, and 04 seconds. I still feel my profile will take more than 6 hours to scan, so only partial successes are in this projects future. It would have been nice to be able to keep my organizations, as then I could split the repositories up, and this wouldn't be a problem. The failure rate for this month has now gone up significantly just this week.

**2023, Sunday, August 20th**

The workflow had another unsuccessful run today, for the 3rd time this month, and the 4th time in history, ending with the workflow running out of time by hitting the 6 hour limit. It failed within 6 hours, 00 minutes, and 25 seconds. I feel my profile will take more than 6 hours to scan, so only partial successes are in this projects future. It would have been nice to be able to keep my organizations, as then I could split the repositories up, and this wouldn't be a problem. The failure rate for this month has now gone up significantly just this week. The failure rate for this month has increased drastically since 2023, August 17th. I decided that I will continue this workflow, even with the failures.

I put the workflow runs into 41 categories:

### Past observations

I made the observation that when successfully ran, only 10 languages are listed, but when it doesn't run successfully, only 15 languages are listed. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

I have noted that a good way to see if it ran correctly or not is to check the overview image card. If it says `No name` instead of my original GitHub username (`Sean P. Myrick V19.1.7.2`) (not my handle, `seanpm2001`) then it ran incorrectly. Otherwise, it worked correctly. For personal usage, I can tell it ran worse when the counted repositories is `800` instead of `900` or `1000` additionally, if my GitHub username doesn't come up, the card puts `0` for the total commit count. **This has been proven untrue with the 2022 September 30th workflow run**

***

### Workflow worries

I have been running this workflow almost every day for almost a full year now. There is a worry that is starting to grow now.

> **Context:** GitHub has a 6 hour limit on workflow runs.

When I started to use this workflow, it took between 2.5 and 3.2 hours to get a full successful run. As of 2023, May 28th, it is now taking between 4.5 and 5.3 hours to get a full workflow run. I fear that at some point, it will be impossible to get a full successful run, as the 6 hour limit would prevent it from finishing.

***

### Accuracy issues

Something that recently roused[sic] my suspicion/caught my eye is that the workflow is not accurately reporting the total number of source repositories. On 2023, May 20th, it reported that I had `3,427` repositories with contributions, while at the time of the workflow run, I only had `3,391` source repositories, meaning it was off by `36`. That is a pretty notable margin of error. - Logged on 2023, Tuesday, May 23rd

### 2023 Early failure

The message to [`@jstrieb`](https://github.com/jsrieb/) was sent on 2023, Tuesday, January 24th, but there has been no response yet. It started working on its own, but I won't close the issue until I decide to.

***

### Season 13 performance speculation

I have been beginning to suspect that a recent bug with the GitHub linguist in my Git-Templates repository is causing the workflow to perform badly this month (2023, July) as I feel the workflow may be scanning up to this repository, then getting stuck (this particular repository is reporting negative language usage, but the internals of the Linguist indicate that data is still being scanned correctly, the logic just isn't being processed correctly) I am wondering if this workflow reads the logic, and not the data. As of 2023, Saturday, July 15th, the workflow has not had a single fully successful run this month, and has had a very high failure rate.

On 2023, July 19th, the workflow had a full success. I am still unsure why it has been doing so poorly prior to this. I feel I can rule out Git-Templates now.

The performance has continued to wane, this full success only happened once, as of 2023, July 23rd.

***

### Season 14 and limitations of the workflow

On 2023, Thursday, August 17th, the workflow failed because it hit the 6 hour workflow limit. This was the second time it has done this to date. The next day, it did it again. I am feeling that my GitHub profile now takes more than 6 hours to scan, and that partial successes are in this projects future. It would have been nice to be able to keep my organizations, as then I could split the repositories up, and this wouldn't be a problem. My profile will continue to grow, and this workflow doesn't seem like it will be able to keep up anymore.
